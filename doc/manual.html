<h2> 1 What is LinPac</h2>
   LinPac is an attempt to create the packet radio terminal for Linux that 
allows wide configurability and easy addition of new functions and special 
functions needed by the user. The aim was to minimize the amount of 'hard 
coded' functions and create the complete set of applications that can be easy
expanded and/or completely reconfigured.   
<p>All functions described in this manual agree with the standard configuration 
 that comes with the distribution package. </p>
   
<p><a name="POS2"></a> </p>
   
<h2> 2 First configuration</h2>
   When linpac is started for the first time, it automaticaly creates the 
directory called <tt>LinPac</tt> in your home directory. This directory contains 
your personal LinPac configuration. When creating this directory LinPac asks 
for basic information and prepares a useable configuration for you.   
<p>LinPac functions are based on the very simple interpreted language (actually 
 it's not a language, it's something like the batch files in DOS). In the 
LinPac home directory there is the subdirectory 'macro', that contains all 
the scripts written in this language, let's call them macros. Each macro can
be run in LinPac and it implements some action. The simplest case of the
macro is normal text file, that is just printed to the screen (or sent to
the peer) when executed. The language is described in <a href="#POS6">chapter 
6</a>. </p>
   
<p>There is a macro called <tt>init.mac</tt> in the <tt>macro</tt> directory. 
 This macro is executed each time LinPac is started and contains the commands 
 to setup the callsigns and other settings. You can modify this file to change
 the initial configuration of LinPac. </p>
   
<p>You may also want to change following files: </p>
   
<p><b>ctext.mac</b> - this file is executed when the peer connects and should
 contain the greeting text <br>
  <b>quit.mac</b> - this is called when user enters the Quit command (end 
of connection). It should print some farewell and disconnect. <br>
  <b>info.mac</b> - contains the information about your system </p>
   
<p>After this you should be able to make your first connection. </p>
   
<p><a name="POS3"></a> </p>
   
<h2> 3 LinPac controls</h2>
   After running LinPac the main screen apears. In the standard configuraion 
 it's divided to five parts (described from top of the screen to bottom): 
  
<ul>
   <li> <b>QSO window</b>: this window contains the text that came from the
 peer and also the sent text and some special messages (different text colours).</li>
    <li> <b>Status line</b>: displays your callsign, current time and some
 information about the current connection.</li>
    <li> <b>Editor</b>: allows you to enter the text you want to send to
the  peer or the commands you want to execute</li>
    <li> <b>Channel list</b>: displays the list of channels whith the callsign
 of connected users. The currently selected channel is highlighted.</li>
    <li> <b>Monitor </b>: displays the traffic on your radio ports</li>
     
</ul>
   LinPac is mostly driven by commands. The commands are entered using the 
editor and must start with the colon (':') in the first column. Lines that 
don't begin with the colon are sent to the peer.   
<p>LinPac allows to make eight connections simultaneously. For each connection 
 one channel is used. You can switch between channels by pressing the F1 -
F8 keys. Each has its own QSO window, status line and the editor. The channel
 list and the monitor are common for all the channles. </p>
   
<p>There is a special channel invoked by presing F10. This channel has no
 QSO window and doesn't allow to make a connection. The text written is sent
 out immediately using UI frames (beacon). </p>
   
<p><a name="POS3_1"></a> </p>
   
<h3> 3.1 Keyboard</h3>
   Following list contains the important shortcuts:   
<p><b><u>Global</u></b> <br>
  <b>F1 - F8</b> : switch to channel 1 - 8 <br>
  <b>F10</b> : switch to monitor <br>
  <b>Alt-X</b> : end of LinPac </p>
   
<p><b><u>QSO Window</u></b> <br>
  <b>PgUp</b>, <b>PgDn</b>, <b>ctrl-R</b>, <b>ctrl-V</b> : scroll one page
 up / down <br>
  <b>ctrl-E</b>, <b>ctrl-X</b> : scroll one line up / down <br>
  <b>ctrl-B</b> : skip to end of buffer </p>
   
<p><b><u>Editor</u></b> <br>
  <b>Cursor keys</b>, <b>Home</b>, <b>End</b>, <b>Backspace</b>, <b>Del</b> 
 : text editing <br>
  <b>ctrl-Y</b> : delete current line <br>
  <b>Enter</b> : send current line </p>
   
<p>Some applications (e.g. mailer) can use the whole screen. On each channel 
 can run only one such application at the same time. It's possible to switch 
 to this application using <b>Alt-&lt;<i>channel_number</i>&gt;</b> (e.g.
 Alt-5) and switch back to terminal using <b>F1</b> - <b>F10</b>. </p>
   
<p><a name="POS3_2"></a> </p>
   
<h3> 3.2 Entering commands</h3>
   Each command is called using its name. Some commands can be abbreviated. 
 In this manual the mandatory part is always written by capital letters. The
rest is optional. Some commands require some extra arguments. The arguments 
 are written behind the command and are seperated by one or more spaces. If
you want to enter the argument containing more than one word, the argument 
 must be entered in quotation marks.   
<p>Example: <br>
  <tt>:color red blue</tt> - calls the 'color' command with two arguments 
- 'red' and 'blue' <br>
  <tt>:color 'light red'</tt> or <br>
  <tt>:color "light red"</tt> - calls the 'color' command with one argument 
 'light red' </p>
   
<p>Most of the command work on the currently selected channel. If you want 
 to execute the command on some other channel, you can enter the number of
 the channel this way: </p>
   
<p><tt>:connect@5 OK0PAB</tt> </p>
   
<p>In this case the 'connect' command is executed on channel 5. </p>
   
<p>The complete list of commands with descriptions is available in Appendix 
 A. </p>
   
<p><a name="POS3_3"></a> </p>
   
<h3> 3.3 Initiating the connection</h3>
   To initiate the connection the <tt>:Connect </tt>command is used. Just 
switch to the channel you want to use by pressing <b>F1</b> - <b>F8 </b>and 
enter the following command:   
<p><tt>:connect <i>CALLSIGN</i></tt> </p>
   
<p>Replace the <i>CALLSIGN</i> with the real callsign of the station you want
to connect. The command can be abbteviated to the first leter only. Example:
 </p>
   
<p><tt>:c OK0PAB</tt> </p>
   
<p>This command will initiate the connecting sequence to OK0PAB. For closing
the connection, you can use the <tt>:Disconnect</tt> command by entering<br>
</p>
<p><tt>:d<br>
</tt></p>
<p> When your  system has multiple radio ports, you can specify its name
before  the callsign like this: </p>
   
<p><tt>:c 2:OK0PAB</tt> </p>
   
<p>This command will try to connect OK0PAB via port 2. When no port name is
used, the default one is considered. At the begining the default port is
the first port in the <tt>/etc/axports</tt> (your system AX.25 port configuration
file). If you want to change the default port, just use the command <tt>:port</tt>.
</p>
   
<p><tt>:port 2</tt> </p>
   
<p>This will change the default port name to '2'. In some cases it is useful
to set another default port for some selected channels. For this the variable
<tt>CHN_PORT</tt> can be used (see <a href="#POS4">chapter 4</a>). When set,
the content of this variable&nbsp; overrides the default port selection for
the particular channel. For example, when you set the variable for channel
4 using<br>
</p>
<p><tt>:set CHN_PORT@4 1<br>
</tt></p>
<p>the port '1' will be used as the default one for the channel 4. For other
channels, the previously set default port will be used.<br>
</p>
   
<p><a name="POS3_4"></a> </p>
   
<h3> 3.4 Receiving and sending files</h3>
   The standard distrubution can receive files using plain text or binary 
transfer and using file transfers protocols YAPP and Autobin. LinPac will 
automaticaly start to receive the file when the peer begins to send using 
the YAPP or Autobin protocols. The 7+ files are automaticaly saved too. When 
you want to save the incomming text you have to use the command   
<p><tt>:Write &lt;<i>filename</i>&gt;</tt> </p>
   
<p>The incomming text will be saved until you stop the saving using </p>
   
<p><tt>:Write off</tt> </p>
   
<p>For receiving the plain binary file corresponding command <tt>:WBin</tt> 
 can be used. This way of transfering binary files is not recommended, use 
 the autobin or yapp protocol instead. </p>
   
<p>There are following commands available for sending files: </p>
   
<p><tt>:rprg &lt;<i>filename</i>&gt;</tt> - sends the file using the Autobin 
 protocol <br>
  <tt>:yput &lt;<i>filename</i>&gt;</tt> - sends the file using the YAPP
protocol  <br>
  <tt>:rbin &lt;<i>filename</i>&gt;</tt> - sends the binary file (no protocol 
 - not recommended) <br>
  <tt>:read &lt;<i>filename</i>&gt;</tt> - semds the text file </p>
   
<p><a name="POS3_5"></a> </p>
   
<h3> 3.5 Remote commands</h3>
   LinPac allows the remote user to enter the commands. For remote control 
all LinPac commands are available but there can be (and should be) some restrictions
 for each user.   
<p>The remote command must start with the <tt>//</tt> sequence. For example 
 if some connected users sends you a text '<tt>//info</tt>' your terminal 
will send back the station information. </p>
   
<p>The remote commands can be disabled using the command <tt>:remote off</tt> 
 and enabled by <tt>:remote on</tt>. You can also specify only some commands 
 to be available for remote users. The default list of available remote commands
 is defined in the <b>init.mac</b> file (the DEF_RCMD line). There is also
 the posibility to enable various commands for each user. This is described
 in <a href="#POS5">chapter 5</a>. </p>
   
<p><a name="POS3_6"></a> </p>
   
<h3> 3.6 Character encoding</h3>
   In some countries there are used more different national character encodings 
 for some historical reasons. An user who has his Linux console configured 
 for example for some of standard ISO encodings may be incompatible with another
one using a traditional encoding. To solve this LinPac allows to translate
the input and output of each channel using a translation table. The translation
tables are stored in files <tt>*.ctt</tt> in the LinPac home directory. 
 
<p>All known encodings have to be defined in the file called <tt>encodings</tt> 
 in the LinPac home directory. This file contains a single line for each encoding
that specifies its <i>alias</i> (name which will identify the encoding in
LinPac), <i>encoding name</i> (an official name such as iso-8859-1) and optionaly
the name of the <i>translation table file</i> to be used (without the extension
<tt>.ctt</tt>). </p>
   
<p>Current encoding can be switched using the <b>:TRanslate</b> command separately
 for each channel. To specify the default encoding for each user you can
add  the line </p>
   
<p><tt>ENC=&lt;alias&gt;</tt> </p>
   
<p>to the appropriate record in station database (station database is described 
 in <a href="#POS5">chapter 5</a>). When no encoding is specified for the 
user, the default one is used. The default encoding alias is stored in the 
DEF_ENC@0 variable which is set in the macro init.mac. </p>
   
<p>When the conversion table is not specified in the encodings file LinPac 
 only changes the name of currently used encoding but doesn't provide any 
conversion. However some applications (such as QLinPac which works in unicode) 
are able to do their own conversions. </p>
   
<p><a name="POS3_7"></a> </p>
   
<h3> 3.7 Huffman compression</h3>
   Some packet radio terminals and BBS software allows the compression of 
transferred text. When switched on, the sender does the compression of all 
data before sending them to the other station and the recipient has to decompress 
the data after receiving them. This makes the communication more reliable 
and reduces the load of the radio link.   
<p>The line compression in LinPac is activated using the <tt>:comp</tt> command.
 The compression is switched on using <tt>:comp on</tt> and switched off
using  <tt>:comp off</tt>. To ensure that the compression is activated or
deactivated  on both ends of the link simultaneously LinPac sends the remote
command <tt>:comp  1</tt> or <tt>:comp 0</tt> to the other station automaticaly.
The arguments  1 and 0 have the same effect as the <tt>on</tt> and <tt>off,</tt>
but they  don't cause sending any command to the other station. </p>
   
<p>In case that the remote system doesn't support the <tt>:comp</tt> command 
 it's necessary to switch on the compression on the remote system manually 
 and then use the<tt>:comp 1</tt> command in LinPac. </p>
   
<p><a name="POS4"></a> </p>
   
<h2> 4 Variables</h2>
   Each channel has its own set of variables. Some of the variables are used 
 to store the configuration data. User can create and remove the variables 
 and change the values of existing variables using following commands:   
<p><tt>:set &lt;<i>variable</i>&gt; &lt;<i>value</i>&gt;</tt> - sets the
value of the variable. If the variable doesn't exist, new one is created.
 <br>
  <tt>:get &lt;<i>variable</i>&gt;</tt> - prints the value of the variable 
<br>
  <tt>:unset &lt;<i>variable</i>&gt;</tt> - removes the variable </p>
   
<p>Some examples: <br>
  <tt>:set NAME John</tt> <br>
  <tt>:set WHOLE_NAME 'John Big'</tt> <br>
  <tt>:get NAME</tt> <br>
  <tt>:unset NAME</tt> </p>
   
<p>The name of the variable can contain the specification of the channel. 
 For example the variable <tt>NAME@5</tt> is the variable '<tt>NAME</tt>' 
defined on channel 5. </p>
   
<p>When LinPac founds the character '<tt>%</tt>' followed by the name of variable,
automaticaly replaces this text with the value of the variable. Considering
previous example the text <tt>%NAME</tt> will be replaced with John. </p>
   
<p><a name="POS4_1"></a> </p>
   
<h3> 4.1 Special variables</h3>
   There are some special internal variables that don't allow changing their 
 value. Their value is set and changed directly by LinPac and this variables 
 can be used to add some actual information to the text. The list follows: 
  
<p><tt>%V</tt> - LinPac version (e.g. 0.02) <br>
  <tt>%C</tt> - The callsign of connected station <br>
  <tt>%N</tt> - The name of connected station (when known), else is replaced 
 by the contents of %U macro <br>
  <tt>%Y</tt>- Channel callsign (mycall) <br>
  <tt>%K</tt>- Current channel number <br>
  <tt>%T</tt> - Current time <br>
  <tt>%D</tt> - Current date <br>
  <tt>%B</tt> - Audible bell <br>
  <tt>%Z</tt> - Current time zone <br>
  <tt>%U</tt> - The text used when the name is unknown. This can contain
other  macros (typicaly %C). <br>
  <tt>%P</tt>- The port number <br>
  <tt>%M</tt>- The number of connected users <br>
  <tt>%A</tt>- The time since the last operator activity <br>
  <tt>%_</tt>- End of line (CR) <br>
  <tt>%&lt;</tt>- Contents of the last line received, this is cleared by
reading  <br>
  <tt>%#<i>number</i></tt> - Replaced by a character with an ASCII value
&lt;number&gt;  (e.g. %#27 means ESC) <br>
  <tt>%(<i>command</i>)</tt> - Replaced by the command result. <br>
  <tt>%[<i>expression</i>]</tt> - Replaced by the result of mathematical
expression  </p>
   
<p>Variables for use in macros only: </p>
   
<p><tt>%R</tt> - the number of macro arguments (up to 9) <br>
  <tt>%0</tt> - the name of the macro <br>
  <tt>%1</tt> - <tt>%9</tt> - macro arguments </p>
   
<p>For example try to write following text in the editor and press enter: 
 </p>
   
<p><tt>The time is %T and the date is %D.</tt> </p>
   
<p><a name="POS5"></a> </p>
   
<h2> 5 Station database</h2>
   The station database holds various information about known stations. All 
 the information is stored in the '<tt>station.data</tt>' file and can be 
changed using the normal text editor or using the LinPac :<tt>Name </tt>command. 
  
<p><a name="POS5_1"></a> </p>
   
<h3> 5.1 The station.data file format</h3>
   The information about each station is written in the paragraph starting 
with the station callsign in the square brackets. Each line in the paragraph 
contains one defininion like   
<p><tt>&lt;item_name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</tt> </p>
   
<p>The typical station information can look like this: </p>
   
<p><tt>[OK0NMA]</tt> <br>
  <tt>NAME=PC/FlexNet Brno</tt> <br>
  <tt>TYPE=FLEXNET</tt> <br>
  <tt>LOC=JN89HE</tt> <br>
  <tt>QRG=144.8125 MHz</tt> <br>
  <tt>SYSNUM=85946</tt> </p>
   
<p>There are no mandatory items, the user can add various items depending 
 on what information he wants to store. Current LinPac distribution uses following
item names for standard information: </p>
   
<p><b>NAME</b> - Text information about the station, or the operator's name.
 LinPac shows this information when connected to that station. LOC - QRA
locator  of the station. Shown after connect too. </p>
   
<p><b>TYPE</b> - The type of the station. For standard stations the types 
 FLEXNET, THENET, FBB, BAYBOX, DIEBOX, TNOS, JNOS, DXC and TERM for user terminals
are recomended, but you can add any other type. </p>
   
<p><b>LANG</b> - The language to communicate with the station. This is currently
 supported by the macros only. When this item is set, LinPac will try to
find  the macro in the directory <tt>macro/&lt;LANG&gt;/</tt>. </p>
   
<p><b>NICKNAME</b> - The nickname of operator. </p>
   
<p>The standard LinPac configuration also uses this item names: </p>
   
<p><b>TERM</b> - What type of terminal is used. If '<tt>ansi</tt>' is set,
LinPac switches to the ansi-color mode after connecting this station. <br>
  <b>ENC</b> - The character encoding. Used to automaticaly switch to the 
i/o character conversion. <br>
  <b>RCMD</b> - The list of enabled remote commands for this station. <br>
  <b>QRG</b> - The user frequency. Used by the logbook. <br>
  <b>SYSNUM</b> and <b>PWD</b> - Sysop password for the station. See chapter 
 <a href="#POS8_2">8.2</a> for more information. </p>
   
<p><a name="POS5_2"></a> </p>
   
<h3> 5.2 The 'Name' command</h3>
   The <tt>:Name</tt> command is used to modify the station database. Running 
 the command without arguments results printing the name of currently connected 
 station. The arguments are used to modify the data:   
<p><tt>&lt;name&gt;</tt> - modify the NAME item <br>
  <tt>-l &lt;locator&gt;</tt> - modify the LOC item <br>
  <tt>-t &lt;type&gt;</tt> - TYPE <br>
  <tt>-L &lt;language&gt;</tt> - LANG <br>
  <tt>-n &lt;nickname&gt;</tt> - NICKNAME <br>
  <tt>-s &lt;item&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</tt> - modify other item </p>
   
<p>The command '<tt>Name -i</tt>' prints all information about the station. 
 When you need to change the information about other than connected station 
 add the argument <tt>-c &lt;callsign&gt;</tt>. </p>
   
<p>Examples: <br>
  <tt>:Name John</tt> <br>
  <tt>:Name -c OK2JBG -l JN89HF Radek</tt> <br>
  <tt>:Name -i</tt> </p>
   
<p><a name="POS5_3"></a> </p>
   
<h3> 5.3 Using the database</h3>
   After any connection establishes, LinPac reads the information about the 
 connected station from the database and creates the set of variables with 
 names <tt>STN_&lt;<i>database_item_name</i>&gt;</tt> containing the values 
 of the items. This variables can be used in macros as described below. 
 
<p><a name="POS6"></a> </p>
   
<h2> 6 About macros</h2>
   <a name="POS6_1"></a>   
<h3> 6.1 Creating macros</h3>
   The macro is a LinPac command that is created using the macro language 
and uses other LinPac commands to perform some action. The macro can be defined
 by creating the file <tt>macro/&lt;<i>command_name</i>&gt;.mac</tt>. It's
 possible to define the abbreviated form of the command, this is described 
 in <a href="#POS7">chapter 7</a>. There are two ways to define a macro: 
 
<p><b><i>a) Text macros</i></b> <br>
  This way is suitable for commands which are intended to produce a larger 
text output (for example station information). When executing this macro, 
each line that doesn't start with ':' is printed (sent out). All commands 
must start with the colon. This is suitable for modifying the text output 
using the IF ~ ELSE ~ ENDIF commands or for including some other commands. 
</p>
   
<p><b><i>b) Command macros</i></b> <br>
  A command macro must start with the line <br>
  <tt>:MACRO &lt;name&gt;</tt> <br>
  Each line of a command macro is interpreted as a command (doesn't start 
with the colon and doesn't need to start at the begining of line). The text 
output is provided by the 'echo' command. This way is more synoptical and 
allows including the comments that must start with the sequence '<tt>;;</tt>' 
and end with the end of line. </p>
   
<p>The macro is called with its name. When the first arguments starts with 
 the '@' symbol the macro is executed from the specified label. For example 
 the command <tt>:convers @SEND</tt> will execute the macro '<b>convers.mac</b>' 
 from the label 'SEND' (see next chapter to see how to define the label). 
</p>
   
<p><a name="POS6_2"></a> </p>
   
<h3> 6.2 Commands used in macros</h3>
   The macro can contain all the LinPac and user defined commands. There
are  also some special commands that can be used in macros only:   
<p><b>MACRO [name]</b> <br>
  Start of the command script definition (see previous section). </p>
   
<p><b>LABEL &lt;label_name&gt;</b> <br>
  Creates a label with specified name. In the command scripts the notation 
:&lt;label_name&gt; can be used. </p>
   
<p><b>GOTO &lt;label_name&gt;</b> <br>
  Jump to specified label. </p>
   
<p><b>IF ~ ELSE ~ ENDIF</b> <br>
  Conditional commands. There are two ways to specify a condition: </p>
   
<ul>
   <li> normal notation (for more than one command)</li>
    &nbsp;        
  <p><b>IF</b> &lt;condition&gt; <br>
  . <br>
  . <br>
  (commands to be done when the codition is true) <br>
  . <br>
  . <br>
    <b>ELSE</b> <br>
  . <br>
  . <br>
  (commands to be done when the condition is false) <br>
  . <br>
  . <br>
    <b>ENDIF</b> </p>
       
  <p>The ELSE part is not necessary - the IF ~ ENDIF notation is possible. 
   <br>
  &nbsp; </p>
    <li> abreviated notation (for one conditional command)</li>
    
  <p><b>IF</b> (&lt;condition&gt;) command </p>
       
  <p>The parentheses are necessary in this case.</p>
   
</ul>
   Following example shows how to use conditions and how to use the data
from  station database. We want to create the macro, that will greet the
operator  of connected station with his nickname or with his name, if the
nickname is not defined.   
<p><b><i>a) The solution using the text macro</i></b> (the comments are actually
 not allowed in the text macros, they are here for explanation only) </p>
   
<p><tt>:if %(exist STN_NICKNAME) == 1 ;; when NICKNAME is defined</tt> <br>
  <tt>Hello %STN_NICKNAME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 ;; greet with the nickname</tt> <br>
  <tt>:else&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 ;; else (not defined)</tt> <br>
  <tt>Hello %N !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 ;; greet with the name</tt> <br>
  <tt>:endif&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 ;;(following commands are always executed)</tt> <br>
  <tt>You have connected to %Y at %T. ;; Say your callsign and current time</tt> 
 </p>
   
<p><b><i>b) The solution using the command macro</i></b> </p>
   
<p><tt>:macro GREETING ;; start the command macro</tt> <br>
  <tt>if %(exist STN_NICKNAME) == 1 ;; when NICKNAME is defined</tt> <br>
  <tt>echo Hello %STN_NICKNAME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;; greet with the

<h3> 6.3 Special system macros</h3>
   There are some special macros that are executed automaticaly by LinPac 
in some cases:   
<p><b>init.mac</b> - This is executed when LinPac is started and its function 
 is to set the callsigns, screen options, and some other parametres. </p>
   
<p><b>cinit.mac</b> - This is executed always when some connection establishes. 
 The distribution version of this macro sets the channel parametres in order 
 to station settings in station database (allowed remote commands, i/o encoding, 
 terminal type) and executes the logbook command to sign a start of connection. 
 LinPac always passes two arguments to this macro. The first (%1) argument 
 is the callsign of connected station and the second (%2) argument is the 
callsign of the previously connected station that provides the connection 
or it's empty in case of direct connection. </p>
   
<p><b>ctext.mac</b> - This macro is executed when some station connects to
 the terminal. It should print some greeting text. No arguments are passed. 
 </p>
   
<p><b>cexit.mac</b> - This is executed always when some connection closes. 
 The distribution version of this macro just executes the logbook command 
to sign the end of the connection and clears the list of allowed remote commands.
 There is always one argument passed by LinPac (%1) and contains the callsign
 of the disconnected station. </p>
   
<p><a name="POS7"></a> </p>
   
<h2> 7 Creating new commands</h2>
   New command can be represented by the macro or by the external program 
(standard linux program or special LinPac application). Macros are placed 
in the <tt>$LINPACDIR/macro</tt> directory and external programs are placed 
int the <tt>$LINPACDIR/bin</tt> directory. In both of this directories is 
the file '<tt>commands</tt>' that contains the list of commands in that directory. 
You should specify here the name of the file, the name of the command in LinPac
(use capital letters to specify the mandatory part of the command). It's
not necessary to include the macros here, if you don't want to define the
abbreviation. <br>
  In case of external programs there is also the possibility to specify the
 program flags. Currently this flags are supported:   
<p>A - Ascii mode program. LinPac provide the CR &lt;-&gt; LF conversion
when communicating with this program. This is the default setting. <br>
  B - Binary mode. Disables the conversions. <br>
  C - Leaves the stdout stream of the program on the console and reads its
 stderr stream instead. <br>
  D - DOS conversion - ignore LF characters. <br>
  S - Reads both stdin and stderr streams of the program (shell mode). <br>
  L - Local. This program is never available as the remote command. <br>
  R - This program is always run as the remote command (its messages are
always  sent out). <br>
  P - LinPac removes the paths from filenames that are passed as the argument
 of this command when the FIXPATH command is on. This is the security option. 
 </p>

<h2> 8 Standard applications</h2>
   <a name="POS8_1"></a>   
<h3> 8.1 File transfer protocols</h3>
   At present LinPac supports two protocols for transfering files:   
<ul>
   <li> <b>Autobin</b> - a simple protocol suitable for short files</li>
    <li> <b>YAPP</b> - very sophisticated transfer protocol that provides 
better  error detection and is able to resume previously interrupted transfer</li>
     
</ul>
   Usage of this protocols is described in chapter <a href="#POS3_4">3.4</a>. 
  
<p>LinPac can also automaticaly save incomming 7+ files. After saving all 
 parts of file LinPac tries to call the '7plus' program to decode the file. 
 Received 7+ files are not removed automaticaly. </p>
   
<p><a name="POS8_2"></a> </p>
   
<h3> 8.2 Automatic password generation</h3>
      
<h4> <a name="POS8_2_1"></a>8.2.1 Login passwords</h4>
   LinPac provides automatic replies to the login authorization requests
for  following systems: F6FBB BBS (VE2BLY C_FILTER), BAYBOX, TNOS (numeric
MD5).  Each station which requests the login password must have an entry
in the station database containing at least following fields:   
<p><tt>TYPE=&lt;<i>station_type</i>&gt;</tt> (FBB, BAYBOX or TNOS) <br>
  <tt>LOGINPW=&lt;<i>login_password</i>&gt;</tt> <br>
  <tt>PWPROMPT=&lt;<i>BBS_prompt</i>&gt;</tt> </p>
   
<p><i><tt>BBS_prompt</tt></i> is the text which the BBS sends when requesting 
 the authorization. Usually it looks like 'Password&gt;' or 'OK0XYZ&gt;'. 
</p>
   
<h4> <a name="POS8_2_2"></a>8.2.2 Sysop and general use passwords</h4>
   LinPac provides autimatic authorization to following systems: F6FBB BBS 
(MD2 password), FLEXNET (older versions, the 'magic' numbers system and newer
 TheNet-like system), THENET and BAYBOX. Each station you want authorize
to  must have anentry in the station database. For password generation following 
 fields must be set:   
<p><tt>TYPE=&lt;<i>station_type</i>&gt;</tt> <br>
  <tt>PWD=&lt;<i>your_password</i>&gt; or</tt> <br>
  <tt>SYSNUM=&lt;<i>magic_number</i>&gt;</tt> </p>
   
<p>Known station types are: </p>
   
<ul>
   <li> <b>FBB</b> - An F6FBB BBS. The PWD field must contain your password.</li>
    <li> <b>THENET</b> - A TheNet node. Again the PWD must contain the password.</li>
    <li> <b>BAYBOX</b> - The same system as TheNet.</li>
    <li> <b>FPAC</b> - A FPAC node. Password must be stored in the PWD field.</li>
    <li> <b>FLEXNET</b> - FlexNet node. If the magic number algorithm is
used  (older versions of flexdigi) the SYSNUM field must contain your magic
number  and the PWD field mustn't be set. When the TheNet algorithm is used
(newer  versions of flexdigi), the PWD field must contain the password and
the SYSNUM  field mustn't be used.</li>
     
</ul>
   In case of <b>FBB</b> the authorization algorithm can be choosed by setting 
 the <b>MD</b> field in the station database: <br>
  <tt>MD=5</tt> - this value will select the MD5 algorithm <br>
  <tt>MD=2</tt> - this value will select the MD2 algorithm   
<p>When no value is set, MD2 algorithm is used. </p>
   
<p>After connecting to the station you want authorize to the authorization 
 sequence begins with the <tt>:PW</tt> command. LinPac will send the authorization 
 command to the station and tries to answer the authorization request using 
 your password. If the password is correct, authorization should finish succesfuly. 
 </p>
   
<p>The PW command accepts following parametres: </p>
   
<p><tt>:PW [&lt;<i>command</i>&gt; [&lt;<i>system</i>&gt; [&lt;<i>password</i>&gt;]]]</tt> 
 </p>
   
<p>where <br>
  <tt>&lt;<i>command</i>&gt;</tt> is the command to be send to the remote 
station to start authorization sequence (<i>sys</i> by default) <br>
  <tt>&lt;<i>system</i>&gt;</tt> is one of the above-mentioned supported
systems,  this system is used instead of the one specified in station database
<br>
  <tt>&lt;<i>password</i>&gt;</tt> is the password that will be used instead 
 of the one specified in the station database </p>
   
<p>It's recommended to create simple macros for frequently used authorizations 
 thad require special arguments to PW command. </p>
   
<p><a name="POS8_3"></a> </p>
   
<h3> 8.3 Utilities for mail exchange</h3>
   LinPac contains some utilities for exchanging mail with the F6FBB BBS. 
For the proper function of this utilities following variables must be created 
 in channel 0:   
<p><b>HOME_BBS</b> - The AX.25 path to the home BBS including the port name.
 For example <tt>kiss:OK0PAB OK0NMA</tt> is the BBS <tt>OK0PAB</tt> which
can be connected on port <tt>kiss</tt> via the node <tt>OK0NMA</tt>. <br>
  <b>HOME_ADDR</b> - The full hierarchical address of the BBS. For example 
<tt>OK0PAB.#MOR.CZE.EU</tt>.  </p>
   
<p>For setting the variable the <tt>:SET</tt> command can be used. For example: 
 </p>
   
<p><tt>:set HOME_BBS@0 "kiss:OK0PAB OK0NMA"</tt> </p>
   
<p>The reccomended place to set this variables is the startup macro <tt>init.mac</tt>. 
 The default version of this macro contains an example of setting this variables. 
 After setting this variables following commands are available: </p>
   
<p><tt>:GETMSG &lt;<i>message_number</i>&gt; [&lt;<i>message_number</i>&gt;
 ...]</tt> <br>
  Reads specified messages from the BBS and stores them into <tt>/var/ax25/mail/&lt;<i>BBS_callsign</i>&gt;/&lt;<i>message_number</i>&gt;</tt>. 
 The directory for the BBS must be created before using this command (use 
capital letters for the BBS callsgin). When the message number starts with 
the letter <b>'p'</b>, the message is considered as a personal one and it's 
killed automaticaly after download. You can specify the kill command by setting 
the <tt>KILLPERS</tt> variable in channel 0 using the <b>#</b> character for
the number of message (e.g. <tt>:set KILLPERS@0 "kill #"</tt>). When this
variable is not set, the default command <tt>K #</tt> is used. </p>
   
<p><tt>:SP &lt;<i>address</i>&gt;</tt> or <tt>:SB &lt;<i>address</i>&gt;</tt> 
 <br>
  This commands can be used for creating new private message or the bulletin. 
 The usage is the same as at the FBB BBS. </p>
   
<p><tt>:FORWARD</tt> <br>
  Transfers all new messages to the BBS. </p>
   
<p><tt>:DELMSG &lt;<i>message_number</i>&gt;</tt> <br>
  Marks the message for delete. </p>
   
<p><tt>:PACK</tt> <br>
  Deletes all marked messages. </p>
   
<p><a name="POS8_4"></a> </p>
   
<h3> 8.4 Mail client</h3>
   This application allows full screen message editing and browsing. It provides 
 the frontend to mail exchange utilities. Mail client is started by the <tt>:MAIL</tt> 
 command. After the program is started the <b>H</b> key shows the operating 
 instructions.   
<p><a name="POS8_5"></a> </p>
   
<h3> 8.5 Logbook</h3>
   Logbook is a simple application that is started from the cinit.mac and 
cexit.mac scripts (at the begining and at the end of each connection). It 
creates the file in the 'log' directory for each callsign and writes here 
the time when the connections were started and finished and the QRG. The QRG
is taken from the <tt>QRG</tt> field of the station entry in station database.
If the station has no QRG defined, the value from the <tt>QRG@0</tt> variable
is taken.   
<p><a name="POS9"></a> </p>
   
<h2> 9 Command line options</h2>
   LinPac accepts following command line options:   
<ul>
    <b>-m</b> : disable monitor. When this option is used, LinPac doesn't 
create it's internal monitor objects and saves memory.       
  <p><b>-s</b> : disable <i>ax25spyd</i>. Linpac normaly tries to connect 
   <i>ax25spyd</i> to get monitor data and when the connection fails, the 
  <i>listen</i> utility is used instead. When <b>-s</b> swicth is used, LinPac 
doesn't try to connect <i>ax25spyd</i> at all. </p>
       
  <p><b>-d</b> : daemon mode. LinPac doesn't initialize the screen and runs 
 in the background. </p>
       
  <p><b>-p &lt;string&gt;</b> : specify the arguments for the <i>listen</i> 
 program. Default value is <tt>ar8</tt>.</p>
   
</ul>
