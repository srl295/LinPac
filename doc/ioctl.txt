In LinPac 0.12 there is included some experimental code for getting the AX.25
status via ioctl. The reason is that the currently used method of getting
the AX.25 status via the /proc filesystem often interferes with some
radio modem drivers (e.g. baycom modem drivers).

However current kernels (at the time of writing this text the latest stable
linux kernel release was 2.2.14) don't support getting all the important
information via ioctl. That's why some information is not displayed when
using this method but it's better than nothing for baycom modem users.

As the code is experimental, there are no particular commands to switch
the modes and all control is done via system requests (:sysreq command).

Following requests can affect the status line behavior:
(type the command again to cancel it)

:sysreq 3        - enable the ioctl method for infolevel 1 (less detailed
                   status line)

:sysreq 4        - force the ioctl method for all infolevels

:sysreq 5        - toggle the /proc/net/ax25 format between 2.0.x and 2.2.x
                   The mode is normally automaticaly detected by LinPac, you
                   shouldn't need to use this request.
