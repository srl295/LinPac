Creating the CTT (Charset conversion table) files
=================================================

SRC = source encoding (remote system encoding)
DEST = destination encoding (local Linux console encoding)

There is a file "table.tab" located in the same directory as this document.
You will need any conversion software that can convert between SRC and DEST
charsets in both directions (e.g. Trans http://www.kostis.net/freeware/).

1. Convert the file "table.tab" from SRC to DEST and store to tab1.tab
2. Convert the file "table.tab" from DEST to SRC and store to tab2.tab
3. cat tab1.tab tab2.tab >result.ctt

The resulting file should be 512 bytes long.

For installing the encoding table to LinPac just copy the file *.ctt to
$HOME/LinPac/
You may need to update the file $HOME/LinPac/encodings.
