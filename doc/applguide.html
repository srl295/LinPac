<h2>
1 Introduction</h2>
This guide is written for the programmers who want to add some new functions
to LinPac. In following text the basic knowledge about Linux programming
is assumed. It's also recommended to read the user manual first.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="POS2"></a>
<h2>
2 What is an external program</h2>
An external program is a standard Linux application which uses LinPac to
communicate with remote station. There are basicaly two types of LinPac
external programs:
<ul>
<li>
Standard Linux applications that use standard input and output streams.
This programs can be used without LinPac too. LinPac allows redirect ion
of the input stream (stdin) of the application and any of the output streams
(stdout, stderr) or both of them. LinPac can also provide the CR/LF conversions
in this streams. This parametres are set when adding the external program
to LinPac - see the <a href="manual.html#POS7">section 7</a> "Creating
new commands" in the user manual.</li>

<li>
Application written using the application interface of LinPac. This applications
can share some information with LinPac and they can control almost all
functions of LinPac.</li>
</ul>
No special knowledge about LinPac is needed for creating the first type
of programs because no LinPac functions are used. Following sections of
this guide are dedicated to the second type of applications.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="POS3"></a>
<h2>
3 Basic concepts of the API</h2>
The application interface of LinPac is based on <i>events</i>. Every action
in LinPac such as pressing a key, receiving a data, executing a command,
etc. is represented by a data structure called <i>event</i> which describes
what exactly happened. LinPac's internal structure consists of separate
<i>objects
</i>which
communicate with each other using the events. Each object provides its
own functionality, it often generates events - e.g. the object <b>Keyscan</b>
produces an event each time any key is pressed.
<p>All the events generated by any object are put to the common <i>event
queue</i>. LinPac kernel simply takes the events from the queue one by
one and sends them to all the objects (including the one that generated
the event). Thus <b>each event generated by any part of LinPac is forwarded
to all the objects</b>. The reaction of each object fully depends on its
functionality but of course it can include generation of another events.
<p>The list of LinPac internal objects and their names can be found in
the file <a href="objects.txt">objects.txt</a>.
<p>An additional feature of the API is shared variable environment. This
is a set of variables that are shared with linpac - their values are automaticaly
synchronized in all the external programs. These variables are accessed
using special functions of interface library as described below.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="POS4"></a>
<h2>
4 How do applications communicate with LinPac</h2>
LinPac uses the TCP/IP sockets for the communication with the external
programs (applications). The connection is always initiated by the application
after it starts. There are basicaly two ways how the application is started:
<ol>
<li>
The application is started by LinPac (it is associated to some LinPac command).
In this case LinPac registers the channel where the application was started
and expects the connection attempt from the application. After the application
initializes and contacts LinPac, it is told the working channel and whether
it was started by remote or local user. LinPac may also redirect the input
and output streams of the application (depends on LinPac settings).</li>

<li>
The application is started without using LinPac. In this case LinPac assumes
that the application runs on channel 0 and was started by local user. The
input and output streams of the application are not redirected.</li>
</ol>
In both cases the start of an application causes the creation of a new
object in LinPac called <i>event gate</i>. This object represents the application
within LinPac. Considering previous chapter it means that the application
is forwarded all the events generated by any LinPac object and all the
events generated by an application are forwarded to all the objects.
<p><b>NOTE: </b>All the communication via TCP/IP sockets is provided by
the LinPac application library. The user application shouldn't access the
sockets directly.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="POS5"></a>
<h2>
5 Using the application library</h2>
During LinPac installation the application library <code>liblinpac</code> is
created and installed by default to <code>/usr/local/lib</code>. The interface
to this library is contained in the files <code>lpapp.h</code> and it's installed
by default to <code>/usr/local/include/linpac</code>. Next chapter shows how
to use the library with the user program.
<p><a NAME="POS5_1"></a>
<h3>
5.1 The simplest application</h3>
Following application example just tries to contact LinPac and prints the
result.

<pre><code>
---------------------------- File test1.c ---------------------------
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;linpac/lpapp.h&gt;

int main()
{
    if (lp_start_appl())
    {
        printf("Application started\n");
        sleep(10);
        printf("Application finished\n");
        lp_end_appl();
    }
    else
    {
        printf("LinPac is not running\n");
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>

<p>The function <code>lp_start_appl()</code> tries to contact LinPac and returns
<b>1</b>
in case of succes or <b>0</b> when LinPac cannot be connected (probably
it's not running). This function should precede the usage of any other
application library function.
<p>The function <code>lp_end_appl()</code> closes the connection to LinPac.
<p>How to compile this example:
<p><code>gcc -o test1 test1.c -llinpac</code>
<p>This example just detects if LinPac is running and it can be executed
directly from the shell. When running from the shell, no streams are redirected
to LinPac and the application seems to run on channel 0 of LinPac. It's
useful for some applications that are used to control linpac from outside.
However it's not a typical case.
<p>For most of the applications it's better to copy the executable to the
<code>$LINPACDIR/bin</code>
directory and add it to the file
<br><code>$LINPACDIR/bin/commands</code> as described in the <a href="manual.html">user
manual</a>. After this the application can be executed as the LinPac command.
In this case the streams are properly redirected and the application output
is visible in LinPac window. It's also possible to select the channel for
running the application.
<p><b>NOTE:</b> the LinPac application library (<b>liblinpac</b>) can be
linked without problems with both C and C++ code.
<br>&nbsp;

<h2>
6 Application programming</h2>
<a NAME="POS6_1"></a>
<h3>
6.1 Events</h3>
LinPac is completely driven by events. Each part of LinPac including the
application can generate the event to inform other parts (internal modules
or applications) that something has happend. Each event is sent to all
LinPac components and application. For example when some station connects
to some LinPac channel, the internal AX.25 interface generates the event
reporting that the station has connected and includes its callsign. All
components and applications now know who has connected and they can do
some actions (the output window prints the information about the connect,
the macro processor executes the cinit.mac macro ...). Each application
can handle all the events too and it can generate events which are handled
by other components.
<p>The event is represented by the following structure:
<pre><code>
struct Event
{
    int type;
    int chn;
    int x,y;
    char ch;
    void *data;
};
</code></pre>
<p>The meaning of each field is following:
<p><b><code>type</code></b> - Determines the type of the event. Actually it
says what happend. There is a symbolic constant defined for each known
event.
<br><b><code>chn</code></b> - It says the channel for which the event applies
(for example if the type of the event reports some data received, the chn
field contains the number of the channel which has received data). There
are many events that apply for all the channels. For this events this field
is not significant.
<br><b><code>x</code></b>, <b><code>y</code></b> - The meaning of field depends
on the event type. The y field is usually not used (it's used by some internale
events only).
<br><b><code>ch</code></b> - This field is used by some internal events only.
<br><b><code>data</code></b> - Depends on the type of the event too. It usually
points to some string data or a char buffer.
<p>All the event types are described in the <a href="events.txt">event
list</a>.
<p><a NAME="POS6_2"></a>
<h3>
6.2 Sending and receiving events</h3>
For sending events the function
<p><code>int lp_emit_event(int chn, int type, int x, void *data);</code>
<p>is used. This generates new event using specified values. Each argument
corresponds with one of the fields in the Event structure.
<p>There are two modes of handling the incomming events:
<p><b><i>a) Reading each event on demand</i></b>
<br>This mode is started by the <code>lp_event_handling_off()</code> call.
In this mode events are read using the function
<p><code>int get_event(Event *ev);</code>
<p>This function returns 0 when no event is available. When there is some
event available, it returns 1 and fills the Event structure with the received
event data.
<p><b>WARNING1</b>: The <code>data</code> field in your Event structure must
point to some dynamicaly allocated buffer. The size of the buffer is reallocated
automaticaly after receiving an event. When the <code>data</code> field is
set to NULL, new buffer is allocated. This field <u>must not be uninitialized</u>.
<p><b>WARNING2</b>: The application <u>must</u> read all events in this
mode. It's not a good idea to stop reading the events because the event
queue can overflow. LinPac automatically kills the application when the
event queue exceeds some reasonable number of events.
<p><b><i>b) Automatical event processing</i></b>
<br>This mode is started by the <code>lp_event_handling_on()</code> call. All
the events are read automaticaly. The user can define his own function
that is called automaticaly when an event occurs. When there's no such
function defined, all events are discarted.
<p>The event handling function must have following prototype:
<p><code>void some_function(Event *ev);</code>
<p>(the function name can be different). After initializing the application
the event handling function must be registered using the function <code>lp_set_event_handler(</code>)
from the apllication library.
<p>Following example is an application that prints the types of all events
received and stops when an event <code>EV_ABORT</code> is received. This event
can be generated using the <code>:ABort</code> command in LinPac.

<pre><code>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;linpac/lpapp.h&gt;

int aborted = 0;

//User event handling function. This function is called each time
//an event occurs
void my_event_handler(Event *ev)
{
    printf("The event of type %i has been received\n", ev->type);
    if (ev->type == EV_ABORT) aborted = 1;
}

int main()
{
    if (lp_start_appl())
    {
        lp_event_handling_on(); //turn on automatic event handling
        lp_set_event_handler(my_event_handler); //define own event handler

        printf("Application started\n");
        printf("Stop with the ':Abort' command\n");

        do ; while(!aborted); //wait until application is aborted

        printf("Application finished\n");
        lp_end_appl();
    }
    else
    {
        printf("LinPac is not running\n");
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>

<p>This example contains "active waiting" (the <code>do ; while(...)</code>
construction). This is very ugly. For this reasons LinPac API offers an
alternative for waiting for the events: the <code>lp_wait_event()</code> function.
Let's change the example to use this function:

<pre><code>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;linpac/lpapp.h&gt;

int main()
{
    if (lp_start_appl())
    {
        lp_event_handling_on(); //turn on automatic event handling

        printf("Application started\n");
        printf("Stop with the ':Abort' command\n");

        lp_wait_event(lp_channel(), EV_ABORT); //wait for the abort event

        printf("Application finished\n");
        lp_end_appl();
    }
    else
    {
        printf("LinPac is not running\n");
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>

<p><b>WARNING</b>: Note that some system calls can be interrupted when
the event is received. Interrupted system call returns the error result
and sets <code>errno</code> to EAGAIN (for example the <code>read()</code> call
returns -1) and it must be called again. To avoid this use the interrupt-safe
versions of the system calls contained in the application library (see
<a href="#POS7_3_1">chapter
7.3.1</a>)
<p><a NAME="POS6_3"></a>
<h3>
6.3 Synchronization</h3>
The event generated by an applicatoin is sent to all the modules and applications
including the application that has generated the event. When there's the
need to wait until the event is accepted by LinPac, the simplest way is
to wait until the event we have sent is received back.
<p>For testing that all the events were processed there is an event <code>EV_VOID</code>.
It's not handled by any module. After sending all events just generate
the <code>EV_VOID</code> event and wait until it returns. After that it's sure
that all previous events have been processed.
<p><a NAME="POS6_4"></a>
<h3>
6.4 Shared variables and configuration</h3>
Each shared variable denoted by its name (string) and channel number. Each
variable has its value represented by a string (char[]). The access to
the variables is provided by following functions:
<p><b><code>void lp_set_var(int chn, const char *name, const char *value)</code></b>
<br>Changes the value of the variable. If the variable doesn't exist, it
is created.
<p><b><code>char *lp_get_var(int chn, const char *name)</code></b>
<br>Reads the value of the variable. Returns NULL if the variable doesn't
exist.
<p><b><code>void lp_del_var(int chn, const char *name)</code></b>
<br>Deletes the variable.
<p><b><code>void lp_clear_var_names(int chn, const char *prefix)</code></b>
<br>Deletes all variables with the name
<p>The value of each variable is automaticaly synchronized with LinPac
and all running applications. The variables whose names start with "_"
are reserved for system use. These variables can be used for obtaining
system configuration and status but it may be potentialy dangerous to change
some of these variables. Currently following system variables are defined
(in channel 0):
<p><b>_remote</b> - contains 1 when remote commands are enabled
<p><b>_cbell</b> - 1 when connect sound is enabled
<br><b>_knax</b>&nbsp; - 1 when sound signal for each frame is enabled
<p><b>_def_port</b> - default port name
<br><b>_unportname</b> - port name for unproto frames
<br><b>_unport</b> - port number for unproto frames
<p><b>_info_level</b> - status-line level (0 to 2)
<br><b>_no_name</b> - default station name
<br><b>_timezone</b> - local timezone name
<br><b>_swap_edit</b> - 1 when swapedit is on
<br><b>_fixpath</b> - 1 when fixpath is on
<br><b>_daemon</b> - 1 when linpac works as a daemon
<br><b>_monitor</b> - 1 when monitor is enabled
<br><b>_no_monitor</b> - 1 when monitor is disabled from command line
<br><b>_listen</b> - 1 when accepting connections is enabled
<br><b>_disable_spyd</b> - 1 when ax25spyd support is disabled from command
line
<br><b>_mon_bin</b> - 1 when monitor filters binary characters
<br><b>_monparms</b> - command line of 'listen' program
<br><b>_maxchn</b> - maximal number of channels
<br><b>_last_act</b> - time of last user activity (same format as the time()
call).
<p>These variables can be read using the <b>get_var</b> function defined
above. Furthermore there are two special functions defined for reading
these variables. This functions expect the name of the system variable
without the initial _.
<p><b><code>char *lp_sconfig(const char *name)</code></b>
<br>Returns the value of configuration variable as a string.
<p><b><code>int lp_iconfig(const char *name)</code></b>
<br>Returns the value of configuration variable as an integer.
<p>Following system variables are defined for each channel:
<br><b>_call</b> - callsign for each channel
<br><b>_cwit</b> - connected with callsign
<br><b>_cphy</b> - physical connection to
<br><b>_port</b> - connected on which port
<br><b>_state</b> - connection status
<p>There are also special functions for reading values of these variables:
<p><b><code>int lp_chn_status(int chn)</code></b>
<br>Returns the status of a channel. There are following status constants
defined:
<br><code>ST_DISC</code> - channel disconnected
<br><code>ST_DISP</code> - disconnect in progress
<br><code>ST_TIME</code> - disconnecting for timeout
<br><code>ST_CONN</code> - channel connected
<br><code>ST_CONP</code> - connecting in progress
<p><b><code>char *lp_chn_call(int chn)</code></b>
<br>Returns channel callsign.
<p><b><code>char *lp_chn_cwit(int chn)</code></b>
<br>Returns the callsign of connected station.
<p><b><code>char *lp_chn_cphy(int chn)</code></b>
<br>Returns the callsign of physicaly connected station (the first connected
station).
<p><b><code>int lp_chn_port(int chn)</code></b>
<br>Returns the number of the port used for connection.
<p>Last two functions enable changing the time of last users's response:
<p><b><code>time_t lp_last_activity()</code></b>
<br>Returns the time of last activity of the user.
<p><b><code>void lp_set_last_activity(time_t timeval)</code></b>
<br>Sets the last activity time.
<p><a NAME="POS6_5"></a>
<h3>
6.5 Connection status</h3>
There are two special events reserved for obtaining the AX.25 connection
status. When the application wants to get the status of the connection
on certain LinPac channel, it generates the EV_STAT_REQ event on this channel.
As the answer LinPac generates the EV_STATUS event. The <b>data</b> field
of this event points to the ax25_status structure (see <a href="#POS7_2">chapter
7.2</a>). When there is no active connection on the channel, no EV_STATUS
event is generated.
<p><a NAME="POS6_6"></a>
<h3>
6.6 Event usage examples</h3>
Following examples show how to use the events for controlling LinPac. The
complete list of events can be found in the file events.txt.
<p><a NAME="POS6_6_1"></a>
<h4>
6.6.1 Connecting a remote station</h4>
When initiating the connection, the first step is to check, if the channel
is free (it is not used for other connection). The status of a channel
can be checked using the <code>lp_chn_status()</code> function (see
<a href="#POS6_4">chapter
6.4</a>).
<p>The second step is emiting the <code>EV_CONN_LOC</code> event on apropriate
channel. The <code>data</code> field of the event contains a c-string with
the destination address like <b>port:callsign [digi [digi ...]]</b>.
<p>The last step is to wait until the connection establishes. For this
the function <code>lp_wait_connect()</code> can ve used. An example piece of
code follows:

<pre><code>
---------------------------------------------------------------------
int chn = lp_channel();
if (lp_chn_status(chn) == ST_DISC)
{
    char addr[30];
    strcpy(addr, "kiss:OK0PAB OK0NMA");
    lp_emit_event(chn, EV_CONN_LOC, 0, addr);
    lp_wait_connect(chn, "OK0PAB");
    /* ... connection established ... */
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>

<p><a NAME="POS6_6_2"></a>
<h4>
6.6.2 Using LinPac commands in programs</h4>
Any of the applications can run LinPac commands by emiting the <code>EV_DO_COMMAND</code>
event. E.g. for downloading a message from a BBS using the <code>getmsg</code>
command following code can be used:

<pre><code>
---------------------------------------------------------------------
char cmd[30];
sprintf(cmd, "getmsg %i", message_number);
lp_emit_event(lp_channel(), EV_DO_COMMAND, 0, cmd);
---------------------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>

<p>Other posibility is using the <code>EV_WAND_RESULT</code> event. The usage
is similar to previous exaple, but the <b>x</b> field of the event has
special meaning: as an reaction to this event LinPac will generate an event
<code>EV_CMD_RESULT</code>
with the same <b>x</b> field and with the <b>data</b> field containing
a result of the command.
<br>An example follows:

<pre><code>
---------------------------------------------------------------------
char cmd[30];
int id = 0;
Event *ev;

sprintf(cmd, "getmsg %i", message_number);
lp_emit_event(lp_channel(), EV_WANT_RESULT, 1234, cmd);
while (id != 1234)  /* wait for the command result */
{
    lp_wait_event(lp_channel(), EV_CMD_RESULT);
    ev = lp_awaited_event();
    id = ev->x;
}
printf("The result is: %s\n", (char *)ev.data);
---------------------------------------------------------------------

7.3 Functions</h3>
<a NAME="POS7_3_1"></a>
<h4>
7.3.1 Uninterruptable versions of some system calls</h4>
Following functions work the same way as the original system calls, but
they are interrupt-safe (they don't fail with <code>errno == EAGAIN</code>).
<p><b><code>size_t safe_read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);</code></b>
<br><b><code>size_t safe_write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);</code></b>
<br><b><code>char *safe_fgets(char *s, int size, FILE *stream);</code></b>
<br><b><code>int safe_fgetc(FILE *stream);</code></b>
<p><a NAME="POS7_3_2"></a>
<h4>
7.3.2 Basic communication functions</h4>
<b><code>int lp_start_appl()</code></b>
<br>Starts the communication with LinPac. The <code>pipename</code> parameter
contains the name of the named pipe used for communication (use LP_PIPE_PATH
here). Non-zero return value means success, zero value means that LinPac
cannot be contacted (probably it's not running).
<p><b><code>int lp_get_event(Event *ev)</code></b>
<br>Read the event from the queue. Non-zero return value means succesful
read, zero value means that the event queue is empty. The <code>data</code>
field of the event structure <u>must</u> be initialized before using this
function (to NULL or to some buffer). This function shouldn't be used when
automatic event processing is used.
<p><b><code>int lp_emit_event(int chn, int type, int x, void *data)</code></b>
<br>Generate new event. The arguments correspond with the fields in the
event structure. Return value is always 0.
<p><b><code>void lp_wait_event(int chn, int type)</code></b>
<br>Wait until the event with the same <code>chn</code> and <code>type</code> values
are received.
<p><b><code>void lp_wait_init(int chn, int type)</code></b>
<br>The same as <code>wait_event()</code> but returns immediately, waiting
is provided by following function <code>wait_realize()</code>.
<p><b><code>void lp_wait_realize()</code></b>
<br>Realizes waiting initialized by <code>lp_wait_init()</code>. All the events
