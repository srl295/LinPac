LinPac version 0.22 (stable release)
Copyright (c) 2015 by David Ranch (KI6ZHD) 

Linpac is a modular console-oriented packet radio terminal for Linux with a 
built-in messaging client.  Using Linux's native AX.25 network stack, it
can support eight concurrent connected sessions (QSOs) as well as send
UNPROTO packets (UI) to any preconfigured ax25 digi path.  Local messaging 
support is currently fairly simple yet Linpac is designed to relay all
messages to remote BBSes for full messaging if configured.  Linpac "stable"
currently supports an Ncurses-based CLI client but there is also an unstable 
Java-based client/server version with a GUI client that's partially 
operational but needs work.

If you encounter any problems when compiling or using LinPac please go to
http://linpac.sourceforge.net for support.

QUICK INSTALATION FROM A RELEASE PACKAGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Release packages can be identified by the presence of the ./configure in
this directory. If the ./configure script is not present, then see the
'Hacking' instructions below.

  Optional: 
  ---------
  If you plan to use Linpac for recieving and sending your packet mail via a
  remote BBS system (not required), you need install the ax25mail-utils 
  package first before first running Linpac. This package can be found
  at http://ax25mail.sf.net


Before compilation of Linpac, you must have these other packages installed:

  NOTE: Though some distributions offer the AX25 libraries natively in 
        their own repositories, they are usually very old and lack several
        important fixes.  You can read more about these improvements here:

           https://code.google.com/p/linuxax25/wiki/Ax25AppsDiffs


   Dependencies:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Debian / Ubunutu package names:    libax25 ax25-apps libncurses5-dev
                 Optional install:    ax25-tools ax25-xtools ax25mail-utils

   Centos / Fedora package names:     libax25 ax25apps ncurses-libs
                 Optional install:    ax25tools ax25mail-utils


        I recommend all users install or build the AX.25 stack from 
        this alternative provider for now:

           https://code.google.com/p/linuxax25/source/browse/#svn%2Fdownloads


Once you have installed the above dependencies, please run:

              ./configure

The default destination directory prefix is set to /usr/local
If you want to change this, add --prefix switch:

             ./configure --prefix=DIR

where DIR is the new destination directory prefix.
(LinPac installs into PREFIX/bin and PREFIX/share/linpac)

After this just type
    
             make

to compile the package and then type

            make install
or
            make install-strip

or 
            For Debian/Ubuntu folks, you might consider using the "checkinstall" 
            tool (must be installed seperately).  This is a tool that will run 
            "make install" and wrap everything into an unofficial .deb file
            for proper packaging


One of these options will install Linpac onto your system.  The "install-strip" 
command will also strip the debugging information from the program (the installation 
is then MUCH SMALLER) but harder to report issues to the developer.


ONCE INSTALLED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once Linpac is installed, you MUST configure the Linux AX.25 system first.
Linpac is only an application that uses a fully functional AX.25 stack.
Please review the various resources on the Internet on how to do this 
such as:

  - Official AX25 HOWTO (old, dated but still useful)
    http://tldp.org/HOWTO/AX25-HOWTO/

  - John Ackermann's pages: 
    http://www.febo.com/packet/linux-ax25/ax25-config.html

  - David Ranch's pages:

KNOWN PROBLEMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  See http://linpac.sf.net for actual problems and their solution.

  The --enable-LINKSTATIC configuration option does not work.


NOTES FOR HACKING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A clean checkout from the GIT source repository is not ready to configure
and compile. You will need the GNU autotools
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system) to create the
./configure script and Makfile templates. Once the autotools are
installed the full build procedure is:

    autoreconf --install
    ./configure
    make
    make install

You can make a release package for distribution using:

    make dist

For debugging Linpac, it is useful to run Linpac in the place of compile 
without installing it. For this the command 'make noinstall' can be used. 
This will create the directory structure in the ./src directory. This is 
only available with the staticaly linked applications.


CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most of the configuration options are described in the INSTALL file.

[broken]
  There is one custom option for linpac; --enable-LINKSTATIC.

  The applicatons are linked using the shared library by default (the library
  liblinpac.so is installed in /usr/local/lib). You can link all the
  applications staticaly by running

            configure --enable-LINKSTATIC
