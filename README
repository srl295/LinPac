LinPac version 0.20 (stable release)
Copyright (c) 2014 by David Ranch (KI6ZHD) 

Linpac is a modular console-oriented packet radio terminal for Linux with a 
built-in messaging client.  Using Linux's native AX.25 network stack, it
can support eight concurrent connected sessions (QSOs) as well as send
UNPROTO packets (UI) to any preconfigured ax25 digi path.  Local messaging 
support is currently fairly simple yet Linpac is designed to relay all
messages to remote BBSes for full messaging if configured.  Linpac stable
currently supports an ncurses-based CLI client but there an unstable Java-based
client/server version with a GUI client that's partially operational but needs 
work.

QUICK INSTALATION FROM A RELEASE PACKAGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Release packages can be identified by the presence of the ./configure in
this directory. If the ./configure script is not present, then see the
'Hacking' instructions below.

If you plan to use Linpac for recieving and sending your mail via a
remote BBS system (optional), please install the ax25mail-utils package 
first before first running Linpac. This package can be found
at http://ax25mail.sf.net

Before compilation of Linpac please run:

              ./configure

The default destination directory prefix is set to /usr/local
If you want to change this, add --prefix switch:

             ./configure --prefix=DIR

where DIR is the new destination directory prefix.
(LinPac installs into PREFIX/bin and PREFIX/share/linpac)

After this just type
    
             make

to compile the package and then type

            make install
or
            make install-strip

to install the package. The install-strip command will also strip the
debugging information from the program (the instalation is then
MUCH SMALLER).


KNOWN PROBLEMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  See http://linpac.sf.net for actual problems and their solution.

  The --enable-LINKSTATIC configuration option does not work.


NOTES FOR HACKING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A clean checkout from the source repository is not ready to configure
and compile. You will need the GNU autotools
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system) to create the
./configure script and Makfile templates. Once the autotools are
installed the full build procedure is:

    autoreconf --install
    ./configure
    make
    make install

You can make a release package for distribution using:

    make dist

For debugging Linpac it is useful to run Linpac in the place of compile 
without installing it. For this the command 'make noinstall' can be used. 
This will create the directory structure in the ./src directory. This is 
only available with the staticaly linked applications.


CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most of the configuration options are described in the INSTALL file.

[broken]
  There is one custom option for linpac; --enable-LINKSTATIC.

  The applicatons are linked using the shared library by default (the library
  liblinpac.so is installed in /usr/local/lib). You can link all the
  applications staticaly by running

            configure --enable-LINKSTATIC
